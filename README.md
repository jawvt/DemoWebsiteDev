PSK Golf League — Demo App
==========================

Overview
--------
This project is a Vite + React + TypeScript scaffold for the PSK Golf League web app. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and includes mock authentication and client-side persistence (localStorage).

Quick start (run locally)
-------------------------
Requirements:
- Node.js 16+ and npm (or yarn)

Install dependencies and run the dev server:

```bash
cd /path/to/DemoWebsiteDev
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

If you need a different port:

```bash
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```

Build and preview production bundle:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
# or serve the `dist` folder using a static server: npx serve dist
```

Project structure
-----------------
- `index.html` — Vite entry (mounts React at `#root`)
- `src/` — React + TypeScript source
  - `pages/` — application pages (Landing, Login, Register, Dashboard, Declare, Submit, Leaderboard, Rules)
  - `components/` — shared components
  - `contexts/` — `AuthContext` (demo auth)
  - `lib/` — localStorage helpers
  - `data/` — sample mock data

Local demo data
---------------
- App data is stored in `localStorage` under the key `psk_golf_data`.
  - `declarations`: array of { playerId, playerName, week, declaredAt }
  - `submissions`: array of { playerId, playerName, week, holes, photo?, submittedAt }
- Demo auth user is stored in `localStorage` under `psk_auth`.

Reset demo data (in browser console)
----------------------------------
You can clear the demo data from the browser console:

```js
localStorage.removeItem('psk_golf_data')
localStorage.removeItem('psk_auth')
```

Security & production notes
--------------------------
- This project uses demo (client-side) auth. Do NOT use the demo commissioner password or client-side checks in production.
- Recommended production options: Firebase (Auth + Firestore + Storage), Supabase, or a custom API + Postgres/MySQL and object storage (S3).
- Move commissioner permissions and score editing to server-side, validate submissions server-side, and add audit logs.

Developer notes
---------------
- To change the Vite dev server port, pass `--port` as shown above or edit `vite.config.ts`.
- Tailwind config is in `tailwind.config.cjs`; styles are in `src/index.css`.

What's on hold
--------------
- Backend scaffolding is currently on hold per project direction. When ready I can scaffold an Express + Postgres API or integrate Firebase/Supabase.

Contact / Next steps
--------------------
If you want, I can:
- Scaffold a minimal Express + Postgres API for this app,
- Or integrate with Firebase/Supabase and update the app to use it.
